This report focuses on choosing the best regression model which describes the appropriate relationship between the input MEG and output MEG. The first part of this report focuses on preliminary data analysis where we intend to plot the data and find correlations and outliers with the help of correlation and box plots. We also find the distribution of the data by plotting a histogram with the density curve and time series plot to find the correlation against time.
In the second part of the report, we intend to find the best model out of the 5. The given models are tested by using various techniques like model estimation, Sum of square errors, log- likelihood, Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion(BIC) and plotting a Q-Q plot to find the error distribution. This process can determine the best model out of 5. Finally, the models are tested with testing data and the model prediction to determine the errors and plot the confidence interval with error bars.
In the final part of the report, we use approximate Bayesian computation(ABC) to compute the posterior distribution of the best regression model and plot the marginal and joint distribution of the two parameters from the selected model. The results have shown that emotional narration does increase brain repones.
NOTE: All the codes used for the assignment are present in the appendix section.
